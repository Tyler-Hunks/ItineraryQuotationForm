- Test thoroughly with various file types and sizes
- Validate JSON structure before webhook submission

## Success Criteria
1. Form submits successfully to n8n webhook
2. All dynamic list functionality works correctly
3. File upload handles size limits properly based on toggle
4. Data validation prevents invalid submissions
5. JSON output matches specified structure exactly
6. Form is fully responsive and accessible
7. User experience is smooth and intuitive

Build this form with clean, maintainable code that can be easily modified or extended in the future.
